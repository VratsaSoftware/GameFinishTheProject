# Finish-the-project Game

You have a limited time to add whatever you like to this project. Use it well. Don't break it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Following them will also show you how to deploy it and create a PR.

### Prerequisites

You need an IDE that is setup for simple Java projects.

### Installing

First clone the repository locally by copying the following in your git console:

```
git clone git@github.com:VratsaSoftware/java19.git
```

Then open your preferred IDE and load the project by navigating to 

```
your_dir/java19/GameFinishTheProject
```

You should be able to run the project at this time.

### Create your own branch

You should be in the master branch currently. It is protected and you cannot push to it.
Create your own branch:
```
git checkout -b your_branch_name
```
And you're ready to start work.

### Finishing up

After you finish with the changes, push your branch:
```
git push origin your_branch_name
```
Then go to github and create a push request from your branch to master. And you're done!
